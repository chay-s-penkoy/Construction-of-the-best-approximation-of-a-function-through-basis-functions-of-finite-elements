# Construction-of-the-best-approximation-of-a-function-through-basis-functions-of-finite-elements
A program written in C++ for constructing the best approximation of a function through basis functions of finite elements. There is work with the matrix, which is stored in tape form. And four methods are used for solving systems of linear algebraic equations (including iterative ones)
